// Creating an AST from the CST

PreReq Knowledge:
Lex/Parse prevent issue of incomplete BoolExpr, so there will always be a valid bool expr at this point.
    BoolExprs are simple in our grammar,
        Limited to (Expr boolop Expr) or boolval

        When we go to perform semantic analysis, we ignore open and close paren, and add according to....

        If WhileStatement, we add WhileStatment, then check children...
            - Should be


Each block is a new scope

We need assignment statements, if statements, while statements, vardecl statements, print statements 

BooleanExprs when within statments are defined as IfEqual IsNotEqual

Groupings:
Assignments
While Statements
