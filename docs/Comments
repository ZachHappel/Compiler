Input:

Start    /     '*'     *       /
--- > 0 ---> 1 ---> 2 ---> 3 ---> 4   accepting, do not create token, start input at pos + 1
                   / \ \___/ 
                   \ /  any but '/'
                   any
                   but '*'

                   Also, if run out of input and uncannot find end of comment, throw lex error and end program eval
                   Our lanuage is so basic, yet this is still something that would not be tolerated by other programming language   

                   This condition would occur at state 2,
