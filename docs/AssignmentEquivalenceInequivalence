By any, I do not mean any -- just anything but the other than the other branch that is a valid char in our language

Start     !      =   
-----> 0 ---> 1 ---> 2  return nonequiv
               \ any
                \___ 3 error invalid symbol at input pos - 1, throw warning? or end execution? 

                For now let us just end execution when these sort of errors are encountered bc it would be easier
                Deal with proper error handling later


Start     =      any   
-----> 0 ---> 1 ---> 2  return assignment, at input pos - 1, begin lexing again from current inp pos
               \  =
                \___ 3 return equivalence
